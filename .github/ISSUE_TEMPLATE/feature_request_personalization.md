## Problem
Students must re-enter their information every time they sign up for an activity.

## Proposal
- Let students save their personal info (name, email, grade, etc.) in a profile or config file (e.g., JSON).
- Auto-fill signup forms using saved info.

## Benefits
- Faster, less error-prone signups.
- Better user experience.

## Additional Context
Inspired by the Cover Letter Generator project.
