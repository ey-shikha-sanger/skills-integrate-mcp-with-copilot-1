## Problem
Activities are hardcoded in Python, making updates difficult for non-developers.

## Proposal
- Store activities and user data in editable JSON files.
- Allow teachers/admins to update activities without code changes.

## Benefits
- Easier updates and maintenance.
- More accessible for non-technical users.

## Additional Context
Inspired by the Cover Letter Generator project.
