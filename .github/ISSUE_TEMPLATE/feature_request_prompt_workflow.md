## Problem
The current signup process is a simple form and may not capture all needed info for complex activities.

## Proposal
- Add a step-by-step, prompt-based workflow for activity signups (e.g., ask for experience, preferences, etc.).
- Use interactive prompts to guide users through the process.

## Benefits
- More flexible and detailed data collection.
- Easier for students to complete complex signups.

## Additional Context
Inspired by the Cover Letter Generator project.
